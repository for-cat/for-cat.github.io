            Hii cat!! I'm writing this on the 16th of march, though I don't think I'll finish today, this'll be writen through out many days, you'll 
            get this a few days after I die probably.</p> 
                
            <p>
            I'm actually planning on recording a voice message, actually I've been planning on that for a long time, if there isn't any vocaroo 
            links in here it's because I didn't get the chance to do it, well if you're reading this then that means I didn't get the chance 
            to do it since if I did I wouldn't be writing this WELL anyway, sorry about that, I know you wanted to hear me, I really wanted to
            do it and I tried a few times but I get nervous and never know what to say and makes me feel really bad.
            <p>
            I always wondered if you told your friends or the people from the trauma factory discord server about me, or if they just think I'm just
            random normal girl. Been meaning to ask you if you ever told but everytime I want to ask I forget like 2 seconds after.
            </p>
            <p>
            I think I'll talk a bit about my life up to now, so you can get to know me a bit more, I want to leave a decent-sized message for 
            you and I don't know anything else I can talk about, so that'll be it</p>

            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>
            As I hope you know, my name is 한혜진 (han hyejin), 2002 gen z retard, was born in china and lived there (shanghai) for my first 
            5/6 years, that's where I got my chinese skills from, also because my parents would randomly talk in chinese to me even after we 
            moved to korea, but generally we'd always talk in korean. My parents were the stereotypical asian parents, the "you go be doctor"
            kind of parents, I guess they left when they figured out I wasn't going to be a doctor (and instead be in constant need of seeing 
            a doctor), even though they were pretty strict with me and would beat me up all the time for bad grades or miss behaviour and all
            that, I had a pretty good childhood. 
            </p>
            <p>
            During primary school I met all of my friends, that I love to this day, we would hang out 
            every day, during school and also after school. probably the best days of my life(?) Middle school was pretty good too but there
            were some pretty bad moments, like when my parents left, don't really want to talk much about that topic, so tldr: I'm useless,
            mother pregnant with my sister, they leave and I stay with grandparents (when I turned 18 they disowned me), so I'm technically 
            parentless. 
            </p>
            <p>
            At least the strict life at home I had ended, I was way more free, and allowed me to spend a lot more time with my 
            friends, after school we'd go to pc houses and just game together all night, actually this might have been the best part of my
            life(?) it definitely would've been if I wasn't traumatized from being left by my parents.
            </p>
            <p>
            I was actually pretty good at physical stuff, I had really good physique(?) if thats how you say it, I was actually pretty good at 
            most sports we'd play, football, volleyball, the thing with the rackets, and even running, I already had heart problems at that time 
            but it wasn't something that would stop me and instead just something i had to be careful about, I've only actually developed a 
            terminal problem 5/6 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
            Because of that, as my health deteorated, I started pretty much spending all my time playing games, because I couldn't do
            any physical stuff, so during late middle school/early high school i was already a top player at osu, which is probably my only 
            actual achievement.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Hi again this is me from tomorrow or actually me from the day after I typed everything that is behind this paragraph, so now I'll 
            keep going.      
            </p>
            <p>
            Anyway, something you didn't know about (I think), my grandparents were also sick, my grandma with the same 
            illness I have, and my grandpa had a lot of health problems that he got from being in military and fighting lots; They both had 
            pretty low income so I had to help at the time, I got a job (still underage), this is how I learnt to drive and why, I guess
            I'm a good driver, I used to drive around delievering car pieces from different car shops to other car shops, it was a pretty 
            unpleasent time, eventually my grandma died, because of that there was no longer need for me to work, since no more need to pay for
            her hospital stuff and less bills in general, shortly after, my grandpa also died; I inherited everything, they didnt leave 
            anything for my parents (for obvious reasons) and thats how I've been living up to now, I sold the car and house we had, which 
            were plenty enough to let me stay ok a few for years, my rent right now is actually extremely cheap so I never had any worries,
            I also barely spend any money on anything, I mean, my biggest expense is alcohol, so I've been pretty good financially I guess.
            </p>
            <p>
            I used to drink my grandpa's drinks in secret and I've always liked the taste, then eventually I got extremely depressed because of 
            (you can guess what), and ended up drowning in alcohol everyday, I would also smoke but I mostly smoked because its relaxing and I 
            enjoyed it, moving back to the alcohol part, I would get drunk and often drink myself to sleep and I was at a very low point, 
            then at the same time I ended up finding out about being terminal, which made things way way worse and I was ready to end it all 
            back then, and I would have if not for minji, she is the only reason I didn't, and I owe basically everything to her. I've accepted 
            dying long ago and I dont care at all that I'll die but it hurts me a lot because of my friends, and you, I dont want anyone to suffer
            because of me, sometimes I wish I hadn't met any of you, so you wouldn't have to suffer because of me, I hate it, it makes me cry.
            </p>
            <p>Hi cat, me again from about a week later.</p>
            <p>
            I'm pretty much a vegetable right now, I can't do anything by myself, minji has been taking care of me recently, she bathes me, feeds me,
            sleeps together with me to make sure I'm ok, she is the only person in the world who doesn't deserve anything bad to happen to them, and I 
            can't imagine how I'd feel if she died, and knowing I'll do it to her hurts me so much, I can't handle it.
            </p>
            <p>Back again a few days later HELLO</p>
            <p>
            Hmmm I've mentioned I had a sister, shes a grown little girl now, in middle school, I've never actually met her, not 
            as her sister anyway, she's in another city far away, I've gone there once just to see her, I watched her leave school and I hopped on 
            the same bus she did, I approached her and gave her some money, I didn't tell her anything, I dont think it'd have been a good thing if
            I did, but i hope at least I made her day better, I've put a big portion of what I have to be sent to her after I die, not straight to 
            her, it'll be on hold until she's 18 and I made sure my parents will never touch it, this way I can make her life a bit easier when 
            she grows up and also let her now she had an older sister that loved her. I'm planning on going to see her once more, next week or so.
            </p>
            <p>
            hi again, it's now the 12th of april, I can't do anything, I can barely move, I've been stuck to bed for the past 48 hours, I'm in so 
            much pain, I feel like my body is being pierced in the chest, everything hurts, like a sharp pain and it doesn't stop. I think I will 
            be dead very soon, I really don't want to die by heart attack, or something similar, I'll probably kill myself soon. I don't have any
            regrets, I lived a good life.
            </p>
            <h2>Last words to you</h2>
            <p>
            Cat. Please dont be too sad, our friendship meant a lot to me, you brought a lot of happiness into my life, especially during my 
            last days. Thank you for all the times we spent together, I hope you continue to live your life to the fullest and find happiness 
            in every moment. You are an amazing person, and I am very grateful to have had you in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don't know what the afterlife is like, but I hope I can remain by your side.   
            </p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p>I hope I go to Heaven, so I see you once again</p>
            <p>My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings</p>
            <p>Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending </p>
            <p>}</p>
